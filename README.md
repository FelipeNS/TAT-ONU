It was a project developed for the [UN](http://www.un.org) challenge  in [IBM](https://github.com/IBM)'s largest Hackathon in Brazil, [BLUEHACK](https://www.ibm.com/events/br/en/ibmclouddiscovery/bluehack/) held on 08 and 09 October 2018, in the PRO MAGNO space in SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil.

### Challenge:

##### How IT can contribute to the fight against trafficking in persons in Brazil

Trafficking in persons is characterized by recruitment, solicitation, transportation, transfer, purchase, accommodation or reception of individuals, through serious threat, violence, coercion, fraud or abuse.

According to UN estimates, more than 2 million people are victims of this type of crime every year - in Brazil there are 3,000, and 71% are girls and women.

The fight against trafficking in persons includes prevention, repression, criminal investigation and victim assistance. And this challenge aims to develop solutions that consider these perspectives, using IBM technologies and counting on the support of UN mentors, ASBRAD (Brazilian Association for the Defense of Women of Childhood and Youth) and the Ministry of Justice.
